# TODO.md

## Bugs
* Very first checkbox does not work in chromium, label is instead clickable.
    => does d3-generated nested label/checkbox layout confirm to standards or browser bug?
* Largest cams are truncated, i.e x-axis not wide enough

## Features
* Refactor/cleanup: consistent CSS classes, naming conventions, consistent style, linting?
* Lables on cams 
* Sort function: By size, model, model/size, (last added -> default?)
* Select all and Select none checkboxes
* Build/deploy process: webpack or similar? deal with separate .js file for data. 
* Popups/links to extra data
* Unittests in d3?
* Titles, layout, font, style etc.
