# Cams

A simple flask website/app that allows the interactive creation of charts plotting size ranges for rock climbing camming devices.
[The chart is available on pythonanywhere](http://dmca.pythonanywhere.com/cams/)
(if it's not overloaded).

The range data, as currently available, is lifted from the [Needle Sports](http://www.needlesports.com/) website (one of many excellent climbing shops in the uk). Any errors are likely from my own parsing of the data.

## Motivation

This is mostly an exercise in learning how to create a webapp/write html, neither of which I've done before. 
I've also been trying to properly complete my rack and, given all the new cams currently on the market and the resulting deals on old models, wanted to see what if I could pick up anything useful on the cheap.
(I'd really like a totem 1.75 but can't justify spending Â£58 on a single cam.)

## Contributors

As a relative beginner, any advice/help on my code is most welcome. 
I can add more cam data fairly easily, especially if it's in a nicely formatted csv and with no characters that are problematic for html.
